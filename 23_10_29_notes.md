## Notes
* This is the beginning of my virtual notes.
I have been writing everything down,
but I decided today that typing things would be more effecient since it's a mix of code challenges along with notes.
* My goal is to write down at least one thing from each video even if it's simple.

### 359.  Global keyword
- doesn't seem super important at this point. Can look this up later if needed.


### 360.  Nonlocal keyword
- Affects the scope of a variable.

### 361.  Why Do We Need Scope?
- Everything can't be global scope. Firstly, that would be ineffecient. Second, every variable takes up memory.

### 362.  Pure Functions
Pure functions have two rules.

A. Given A, it will always return the same B.

B. No side effects

```angular2html
def multiply_by2(li)
  new_list = []
  for item in li:
    new_list.append(item*2)
  return new_list

print(multiply_by2([2, 3, 5])
```
This is an example of a pure function. If you move the print statement to inside the function it is not longer a pure function.

### 363.  map()
- Keep your data separate from your functions. A function acts on data. The data doesn't need to be entangled with the function.
- Always gets the same number of elements back

### 364.  filter()
-Apply a true/false. Filter out some items.

### 365.  zip()
-A need two iterables and we can zip them together. (I love zip!)

### 366. reduce()
- import from functools import reduce [reduce does not come in the regular python package]
- reduce(foo, data, 0)// def foo(acc, item) return acc + item// [reduce always hurts my brain]

### 367 List Comprehensions
-Unique to python. You can use list comprehensions on lists, sets, and dictionaries
```angular2html
my_list = [param for param in iterable]
print(my_list)
```
is the formula. Now let's fill it in.
```angular2html
my_list = [char for char in 'hello']
print(my_list)
```
OR
```yaml
my_list3 = [num*2 for num in range(0,100)] 
```
***COOL!***

Finally,
```yaml
my_list4 = [num**2 for num in range(0,100) in num%2 == 0]
```
This actually makes a lot of sense to me. 

### 367 List Comprehensions for sets & dictionaries
- You can apply this to sets and dictionaries.
